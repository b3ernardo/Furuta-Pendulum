# Furuta Pendulum

Implementation of the **Furuta Pendulum** project, developed as part of my undergraduate thesis in Control and Automation Engineering.  
The goal is to model, simulate, and implement real-time control of a Furuta Pendulum using an **ESP32** microcontroller.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. The ESP32 runs the control loop at 100 Hz (Ts = 10 ms), reading angular positions and velocities from encoders.  
2. The control signal is computed via LQR feedback and applied to the motor driver using PWM modulation.  
3. Disturbances (step or pulse) can be injected to evaluate controller performance.  
4. The ESP32 sends sampled data through the serial interface, which is logged by the Python script.  
5. The collected data can then be analyzed and compared with Simulink simulations.

## üéØ Purpose

This project was developed as an **educational platform for Control Engineering**, combining theoretical modeling, simulation, and practical implementation.  
It enables students and enthusiasts to reproduce the experiment, understand nonlinear dynamics, and test advanced control techniques in a real embedded environment.
